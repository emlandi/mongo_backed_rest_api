Add a CSS process to your Gulpfile including:
-Minification
-Concatenation
-And a watch

Organize your CSS using the SMACSS file structure. I would like to see a proper separation of concerns.
-base.css
-layout.css
-module.css
-state.css

Your process should produce a single .min.css file into your build directory

Your application should be Responsive
-Use a flexible layout
-Use media queries where necessary
